# 30-projects-in-30-days
To increase my skills I'm taking on a 30 day challenge to add one new project to this for the next 30 days.

I enjoy web developement and I'm looking to grow my skills and my portfolio so this will be home to 30 projects that will be created over a period of 30 days.

You can learn more about the idea of the project on my <a href="http://jeremiahsvaren.com/blog/30-project-challenge/">blog</a>.
